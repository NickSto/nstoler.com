This is my personal site.

I use it to host info about me and my projects.

But mainly I use it as my personal playground.

It runs on Django (Python 3) and Nginx, and uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for the design.

## Requirements

The required Python modules are in `requirements.txt`.

- Python 3
- Django 1.11
- Nginx

And, for the `horcrux` app, you'll need the [`ssss`](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/) command to be on your `$PATH`. In Ubuntu, you can install it with `$ sudo apt install ssss`.
