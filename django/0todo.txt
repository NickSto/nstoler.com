Script to transfer notepad/traffic database.
- Idea: I should be able to load Django in the script and use its ORM to save to the Django database,
  without worrying about the specific SQL. All I have to do is load my old database export file(s)
  into a MariaDB instance and interface to it using something like sqlalchemy.

Small utilities?

A way to insert nginx-only static file requests into traffic database.
- Idea: Maybe actually have Django handle all requests, and give a 302 in response to ones for
  static files.
  Implementation: For every request that doesn't match one of the root urlpatterns, check if a file
  at that path exists in the static directory. If not, route it to Notepad.
  If making a call to the filesystem for every request is too costly, at startup (settings.py?)
  you could search the static file dir to get a list of all static files that exist, and hold it in
  memory. Maybe give a web interface to the admin to update the list w/o restart.
- Better idea: Or just write a small daemon to watch the log file and add it to the traffic database.
  Implementation: Could have Django itself launch it when it starts itself.
  It could either make a POST to Django over a special url, or just add it to the database itself.

Optional:

Allow non-admins to see /traffic/monitor or /notepad/monitor.
- But show them only their visits on /traffic/monitor and pages they've edited on /notepad/monitor.
