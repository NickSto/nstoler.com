This is mostly very old code, circa 2011, when I'd only been programming for about a year. It does work though, and I still use the Notepad app every day.

I'm currently in the process of rewriting it with some more modern methods, so I can finally move this codebase out of the 90's.

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.7
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/) (for functional tests)
* sendmail (for test failure alerts)
* Perl modules
  - CGI
  - CGI::Cookie
  - DBI
  - HTML::Template
  - Config::IniFiles
  - Env
  - Encode
