Version 1.0
===========

This is some code from version 1.0 of my site. I've kept it around for reference, and in case I decide to rewrite more of it in Python.

Be warned: it's mostly very old code, circa 2011, when I'd only been programming for about a year.

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.7
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/) (for functional tests)
* sendmail (for test failure alerts)
* Perl modules
  - CGI
  - CGI::Cookie
  - DBI
  - HTML::Template
  - Config::IniFiles
  - Env
  - Encode
